	<h4><font color="blue" size="5"><u><b>Jupiter:</b></u></font></h4>
	<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system â€“ more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.

<h4><font color="blue" size="5"><u><b>Saturn:</b></u></font></h4>
<p><font>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.
